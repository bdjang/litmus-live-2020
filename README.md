# Dropping the `<img>` Tag: Data Visualization Without Images

## Background

This repo contains a PDF file of my Litmus Live Week 2020 presentation slides, a sample email campaign report, and code samples for different types of data visualization for email (horizontal/vertical data bars, data tables, and progress bars).
